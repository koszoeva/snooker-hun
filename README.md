This is an unofficial Hungarian translation of the WPBSA Rules of Snooker.
The second part of the Rulebook (Rules of English Billiards) has also been translated; it is kept on a separate branch in this repo.

This translation was created for training/tutoring purposes only.

The HTML version is generated from an Asciidoctor source file using a cusomized CSS template.
